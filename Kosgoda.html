       <h2 class="Kosgoda-Head2">About us</h2>
       <p  class="Kosgoda-Para1">This hatchery started 1978 as the first Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka founded by Dr. Upen de Silva & Dr. R. S. B Wickremsinghe

        Our lifetime dedication is to make it easy to go green and protect and conserve Sri Lankaâ€™s wildlife and its habitats particularly endangered species.
         Main goal is to save nature for future by leading facilitating and encouraging the human beings to save, conserve and enhance the environment including national habitats flora and fauna.
         Motivate people to take actions for conservation in every way for preservation of flora fauna biodiversity and natural environment.</p>
       
         <h2 class="Kosgoda-Head2">Our history</h2>
         <p class="Kosgoda-Para1">This is the oldest Conservation and Research project started in Sri Lanka in early 1978. It was at a time when all 7 species of sea turtles were on the Endangered list. Of the 7 
            species, 5 of the species were found to be frequenting the beaches of the southern coast of Sri Lanka where they beached, to lay their eggs. These eggs were collected by the villagers and sold in the open market.
         <br>
         
            It was about this time when the famous Swedish camera maker Victor Hasselblad whose cameras were the first to be used on the moon, came into the picture. He happened to be a close friend 
            of the highly renowned Sri Lankan bird photographer, Dr Upane de Zylva , and Victor, having similar interests in photography, had made a donation through Dr Zylva to be used in any form of conservation and research, in Sri Lanka.
            <br>
            The late Dr. Siri Wickremesinghe, happened to be close friend of Dr Zylva. Dr. Wickremesinghe, like his friend,had similar interests in wild life
             and nature and the two of them decided that a turtle conservation project would be the best. It so happened that Dr Zylva knew Similiyas Abbrew, father of Chandrasiri
              and grandfather of Isuru, and when he told him about their intended project, he was only too happy to give part of his property to build the hatchery. Nape, in Kosgoda 
              was a favourite beach for the turtles to lay their eggs, and so it all fell into place. Thanks to Victor Hasselblad and Dr.Zylva and Dr. Wickremesinghe, the turtles have found 
              a safe haven and they are 
            increasing in numbers. It is a wonderful experience to see the hatchlings, once released on the beach, rushing to catch the first wave!</p>
