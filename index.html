    <div class="Para1">
    <p>
        Today thier are 250 species of turtles on earth. From all 250 species only seven species live in ocean. Rest of the 243 species live
        on land or in freshwater pounds. Five out of these seven turtle species in the world visit the shores of Srilankan breed.
        The 5 species are Green turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Olive Ridley turtle, Loggerhead turtle, and Leatherback turtle.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are 3 species of fresh water turtles. They are Parker's Black Turtle, Sri Lanka Black Turtle, Flapshell turtle.
        A normal turtle lays up to 100 eggs and cover it up with sand, after the female turtle will leave to the sea. Thier is a threat
        for the eggs from dogs and lizards, where they eat the hidden turtle eggs. Also sea birds eat the new born turtles when they try to 
        leave to the sea. So this would affect the population of turtles.

     <p>
        Turtle hatcheries are facilities designed place to protect turtle eggs from predators, poarchers. Poarchers of turtle eggs define
        the people who steal the eggs of turtle for selling purpose. And predators are difined as lizards, snakes, eagles that eat the 
        turtle eggs.The main purpose of turtle hatcheries is to ensure the survival of different species of turtles.

     <h3 class="Homepage-head3">How turtle hatcheries work</h3>
     <div class="container2"> 
     <img src="Images/fencheggs.jpeg" alt="Fenched area">
     
    <p>
       Turtle hatcheries collect the turtle eggs from thier nests located on beach and take them to a protected area.
       In turtle hatcheries normaly they build a fenched off sections on the beach as shown in the image to put the eggs to save them 
       from predators. They lables the fenched area with details about the eggs such as the type of turtle, Number of eggs in this fenched 
       section, width and height of egg. This details help for the person who monitors the eggs until they hatch. Once the eggs are hatch 
       the new born turtles ar kept in a safe environment until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean.
